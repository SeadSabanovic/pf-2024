            Over four years ago, what started as a curiosity in the digital
            world quickly became an obsession. The idea that code could
            transform into vibrant, interactive experiences fascinated me. I
            quickly learned that coding wasn’t just about ones and zeros
            <br />— it was about bringing ideas to life.

            Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work with diverse
            organizations, adapting to a wide array of technologies and
            contributing to the development Micro Frontends and large-scale web
            applications.

            Yet, despite working across different environments and projects, my
            artistic side wasn’t fully satisfied. I craved more than just code
            that worked—I wanted to create digital experiences that were as
            beautiful as they were functional, pushing the boundaries of what
            modern web development could achieve.
